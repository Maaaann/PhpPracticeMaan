# PHP & MySQL Practice 

Welcome to my PhpPracticeMan folder

This repo is where I practice backend development using **PHP** and **MySQL** as I continue expanding my full-stack skills. It contains simple examples and experiments that help me understand how PHP works with servers, forms, and databases.

## What You'll Find

- Basic PHP syntax and functions
- Form handling and validation
- Connecting to MySQL databases using `mysqli`
- Executing SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, etc.)
- Handling server responses

## Purpose

This folder is part of my journey to:
- Learn server-side scripting using PHP
- Understand how websites interact with databases
- Get hands-on with real-world backend tasks
- Prepare to build full-stack applications

## Technologies Used

- PHP 
- MySQL
- Apache (via XAMPP)
- HTML (for forms and structure)
